EMPLOYEE CHURN PROJECT
Building a model to predict whether an employee is churned or not


Employee churn, also known as employee turnover, refers to the rate at which employees leave a company and need to be replaced by new hires. It is a significant metric in human resources management and business operations, and it also holds relevance in the field of data science. Here are a few reasons why employee churn is important in the context of data science:

Cost and Productivity: Employee churn can be expensive for organizations. The process of recruiting, hiring, and training new employees requires time and resources. Moreover, when experienced employees leave, they take their knowledge and expertise with them, leading to a loss of productivity. By understanding the factors that contribute to churn, data scientists can help organizations identify areas where interventions can reduce turnover and mitigate the associated costs.

Predictive Analytics: Data scientists can utilize predictive analytics to forecast employee churn. By analyzing historical data on employee behavior, performance, satisfaction, and other relevant factors, they can develop models that predict the likelihood of an employee leaving the organization. These predictive models enable companies to proactively identify individuals who may be at risk of churn and take appropriate actions to retain them.

Employee Retention Strategies: Data science can help identify the key drivers of employee churn, such as job satisfaction, compensation, career growth opportunities, or work-life balance. By analyzing patterns and correlations within the data, data scientists can provide insights to HR departments and management, enabling them to design and implement effective employee retention strategies. For example, by identifying common factors among employees who stay with the company long-term, organizations can develop programs to enhance employee engagement and satisfaction.

Talent Management: Understanding employee churn patterns can provide valuable insights into talent management strategies. Data scientists can analyze the data to identify the characteristics and behaviors of high-performing employees who are less likely to churn. This knowledge can guide the recruitment and selection process, helping organizations attract candidates who possess the attributes associated with long-term success and retention.

Organizational Health and Culture: High employee churn rates may indicate underlying issues within the organization, such as poor management, low employee morale, or a toxic work environment. By analyzing employee data, sentiment analysis, and feedback, data scientists can uncover hidden patterns and correlations that shed light on these factors. This information can be used to address systemic problems, improve organizational health and culture, and ultimately reduce churn.

In summary, employee churn is an essential aspect of data science in the context of human resources and organizational management. By leveraging data analytics and machine learning techniques, data scientists can help organizations understand the causes and consequences of employee churn, predict future turnover, and develop effective strategies to retain talent, improve productivity, and foster a positive work environment.

By using various machine learning and deep learning algorithms, this project aims to build a model to predict the risk of leaving the copany for an employee. The model will be deployed via Streamlit in the end.
